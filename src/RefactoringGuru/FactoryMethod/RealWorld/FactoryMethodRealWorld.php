/**
 * Factory Method Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide
 * which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation
 * to subclasses.
 *
 * Example: In this example the Factory Method pattern provides an interface for
 * creating social network connectors, which can be used to log in to the
 * network, create posts and potentially perform other activitiesâ€”and all of
 * this without coupling the client code to specific classes of the particular
 * social network.
 *
 * Instead of calling constructor of social network connectors directly, there
 * is a special method All social network connectors follow the same interface,
 * which lets the client treat any connector it gets from the factory method in
 * the same way.
 *
 * To add a new social network support to the program, you'll need implement a
 * new connector subclass to create a new Creator's subclass, which will be
 * creating a connector object  and after that create a different social
 * connector object in it.
